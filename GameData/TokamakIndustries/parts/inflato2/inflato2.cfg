	description = After the Kerbin-renowned Porkworks was acquired by C7 Aerospace, they abandoned their Inflato product line to focus almost entirely on spaceplane parts. This left warehouses full of probably almost perfectly good space balloons gathering dust. Tokamak Industries was able to acquire them at closeout prices, and we pass the savings on to you! When we got our hands these, they were just mostly empty shells with 30m² of exciting possibilities. Ignoring those possibilities, the PA330 has been fitted out as a workshop instead. It can hold up to 6 Kerbals with enough elbow room for them to work, but you will want to find somewhere else for them to spend their off time if you are not a fan of mutiny. There was even enough room left over to throw in some surplus life support recycling equipment.
