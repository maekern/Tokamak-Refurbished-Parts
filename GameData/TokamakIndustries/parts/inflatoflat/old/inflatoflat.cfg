	description = After the Kerbin-renowned Porkworks was acquired by C7 Aerospace, they abandoned their Inflato product line to focus almost entirely on spaceplane parts. This left warehouses full of almost perfectly good giant space balloons gathering dust. Tokamak Industries was able to acquire them at closeout prices, and we pass the savings on to you! Like the PA330, the "Feasible Landable Advanced Technology" Inflato module was just an empty shell with an excess of docking ports. Unlike the PA330, it was also annoyingly small, so a command console and a worktable were all that would fit in it when stowed. At least it's roomy when inflated, and quite light for a 4 Kerbal pod. We are fairly sure we cleared out all of the spiders.
