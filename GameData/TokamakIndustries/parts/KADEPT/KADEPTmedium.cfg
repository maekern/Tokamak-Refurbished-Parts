	description = The Kanvas And Duct-tape Entry Protection Thing (KADEPT) designed by DennyTX Ltd is a very light folding heat shield made of high-tech Mystery Goo impregnated fabric, and not just an unusually bulky umbrella. In either case, the KADEPT's ability to unfold allows you to produce a lot of drag for your aerobraking needs in a surprisingly light package. It is however considerably weaker than a conventional shield, so not recommended for high velocities in thick atmostpheres, or indeed for any other use. This version is 1.25m stowed, and about 2.5m extended.
